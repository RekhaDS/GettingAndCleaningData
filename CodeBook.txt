Note:- 
The data was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. And the data for the project was obtained by downloading the following zip file. 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 


The zip file contains data for each of the subjects. The subjects were divided in to two groups test and train.  Measurements were taken for 6 different activities that the subjects performed using the accelerometer and the gyroscope. 


To make the final tidy data set, the steps I followed:-
    Downloaded the file https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and extracted the contents with in the zip file. 

The zip file contains, train and test data sets for each of the subjects. Also, contains feature.txt, describing the columns and the activity.txt describing the activities that the subjects performed for the various measurement.

I have taken only the 66 mean and std. deviation columns in my analysis to reach the tidy data set. I have ignored those columns that do not have an exact match for mean and std deviation. This means I have ignored around 20 columns in my calculations/analysis. The reason being that each of the  features are the members of a set of measurements variables and are not independent measurements.


The final outcome is a tidy data set of 180*68 dimension. The data is tidy because it follows the tidy data principle of :- 
 1)	Each variable measured is in one column
 2)	Each different observation of the variables are in a different row
